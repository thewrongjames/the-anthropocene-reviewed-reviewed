      This website is not associated with John Green, Hank Green, complexly or
      any of their companies or publishers or books or anything official
      like that at all.

    <p>
      If you notice any issues with the website (or, say, <em>are John
      Green</em> and want to ask that the site be modified or taken down
      (to which I would of course comply)) feel free to reach out to me
      on <a href="https://twitter.com/thewrongjames">Twitter</a> or
      through <a href="mailto:hello@jameswright.me">email</a>.

      If I have gotten around to making it public by then, you may even
      be able to make a pull request
      on <a href="https://github.com/thewrongjames/the-anthropocene-reviewed-reviewed">
      GitHub</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In case you were wondering, this website is <em>also</em> not
      associated with <a href="https://theanthropocenereviewed.com/">
      that other awesome fan project website</a>, but, you know, I
      thoroughly recommend checking that out regardless.
