# The Anthropocene Reviewed Reviewed

Hopefully this will eventually be the source for a website where you review
different episodes of a podcast where John Green reviews different aspects of
the human-centred planet on a five star scale.

## TODO

- Delete the firebase functions, I don't think I actually need them?
  - Oh, actually, I might need them for summarising review data for better less reads.
- Update `App.test.tsx` to at least function.
- Pagination.
- Probably change to `npm ci` rather than `npm install` in github action.
