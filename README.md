# The Anthropocene Reviewed Reviewed

Hopefully this will eventually be the source for a website where you review
different episodes of a podcast where John Green reviews different aspects of
the human-centred planet on a five star scale.

## TODO

- Delete the firebase functions, I don't think I actually need them?
  - Oh, actually, I might need them for summarising review data for better less reads.
  - Oh also for CAPTCHA, reCAPTCHA, hCAPTCHA, something to reduce spamability.
  - Okay, no, they cost money. Let's stick to free and totally spamable.
  - Guess that means no summaries. Oh well. That's fine for an MVP.
- Update `App.test.tsx` to at least function.
- Probably change to `npm ci` rather than `npm install` in github action.
- Develop a proper way to toggle emulator use.
